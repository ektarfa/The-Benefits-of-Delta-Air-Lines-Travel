It grew significantly during the post-World War II period, acquiring several competitors.

- **Merger with Northwest Airlines (2008):** One of the key milestones in Delta’s history was its merger with **Northwest Airlines** in 2008. This created one of the world’s largest airlines in terms of passenger traffic and network reach, allowing Delta to strengthen its global presence.
